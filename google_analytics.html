Configure multi-channel funnels :
---------------------------------
		series of actions taken by a prospect during his path to purchase
	
	automatically detected:
		unpaid search (all search engines)
		referrals from other websites (including social media sites)
		direct traffic (that can arrive if people used bookmarks or typed your site's URL into the browser)

	
	Need to setup:
		AdWords
		paid search on non-Google search engines
		custom campaigns

	Direct. 
		These visitors come to you from direct URL entries through the address bar or other non-trackable ways. Mostly, we can assume the customer was aware of you and your business prior to visiting.
	Organic Search. 
		These visitors utilized Bing, Yahoo, Google, or any of the other search engines to either search for your products specifically, your product set in general, or your brand name. Any search from a search engine that generates a visit from natural, non-paid search results will end up under organic search.
	Paid Search. 
		In Google Analytics, this refers to clicks and visits from your Google AdWords results for ads that show up on Google Search results pages — not Google Display Advertising.
	Referral.
		Generally speaking, these visitors are sent to your website from other content websites, like a blog post about your company, a press release, or some other form of media mention. In some cases, shopping comparison or affiliate traffic may end up here.
	Display. 
		This is also Google paid advertising, in the form of banners and Product Level ads for ecommerce shops.
	Social Network. 
		Google categorizes many sites in this category, but the big ones remain Facebook and Twitter.

	Last Interaction attribution model
		the last touchpoint—in this case, the Direct channel—would receive 100% of the credit for the sale.
     
    Icon for Last Non-Direct and last AdWords Click In the Last Non-Direct Click attribution model, all direct traffic is ignored, and 100% of the credit for the sale goes to the last channel that the customer clicked through from before converting—in this case, the Email channel.
     
    Icon for Last Non-Direct and last AdWords Click In the Last AdWords Click attribution model, the last AdWords click—in this case, the first and only click to the Paid Search channel —would receive 100% of the credit for the sale.
     
    First Interaction model icon In the First Interaction attribution model, the first touchpoint—in this case, the Paid Search channel—would receive 100% of the credit for the sale.
     
    Linear model icon In the Linear attribution model, each touchpoint in the conversion path—in this case the Paid Search, Social Network, Email, and Direct channels—would share equal credit (25% each) for the sale.
     
    Time Decay model icon In the Time Decay attribution model, the touchpoints closest in time to the sale or conversion get most of the credit. In this particular sale, the Direct and Email channels would receive the most credit because the customer interacted with them within a few hours of conversion. The Social Network channel would receive less credit than either the Direct or Email channels. Since the Paid Search interaction occurred one week earlier, this channel would receive significantly less credit.
     
    Position Based model icon In the Position Based attribution model, 40% credit is assigned to each the first and last interaction, and the remaining 20% credit is distributed evenly to the middle interactions. In this example, the Paid Search and Direct channels would each receive 40% credit, while the Social Network and Email channels would each receive 10% credit.
