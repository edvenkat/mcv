NFC Mobile Payment Application

1. We need to create the registartion page for user with following data
	- id
	- name
	- Age
	- Address
	- Phone No
2. We need to create registration page for vendor.
3. We need to create page for vendor to update their information.




FYI - 
	- We have found the cordova NFC plugin for Andriod(http://plugreg.com/plugin/chariotsolutions/phonegap-nfc) not ios.
	- Some link said "You can't, iOS NFC is limited to only Apple Pay".
